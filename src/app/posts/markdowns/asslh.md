LLVM already includes mitigations against Spectre v1 variants using Speculative Load Hardening (SLH). However, recent research shows that this is still susceptible to control-flow and data leakage attacks.

**Ultimate SLH (USLH)** was proposed at USENIX '23 and builds on earlier work known as **SSLH**. These enhancements were originally designed for x86 architectures.

To demonstrate that ARM is also vulnerable, we developed several proof-of-concept (PoC) attacks. We then updated the `AARCH64SLH` pass to address the vulnerabilities described in the paper.
